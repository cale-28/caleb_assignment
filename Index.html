<p style="font-size: 19pt;">The start of President Trump’s rally was still hours away when it became clear <br>that his campaign would not keep its promise.</p>

<p style="font-size: 19pt;">In the days leading up to the Sept. 30 event in Duluth, Minn., local officials had <br>privately pressed the campaign to abide by state public health guidelines aimed<br> at slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus, documents show. In response, <br>the campaign signed an agreement pledging to follow those rules, limiting <br>attendance to 250 people. </p>

<p style="font-size: 19pt;">On the day of the rally, however, Trump supporters flooded onto the tarmac at <br>Duluth International Airport. They stood shoulder to shoulder, many without <br>masks. <br></p>

<p style="font-size: 19pt;">“We have been notified that the 250 person limit has been exceeded,” an airport <br>representative emailed a campaign official late that afternoon. “This email <br>serves as our notice of a contract violation and we are requesting you remedy the <br> situation.”</p>
